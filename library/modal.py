"""modal.py - classical vibration and modal analysis.

Vibration analysis predicts how structures and machines oscillate. These
helpers cover the single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) spring-mass-damper - the
building block of all vibration theory - plus a multi-DOF eigenvalue solver
that finds natural frequencies and mode shapes using numpy's linear algebra.

It also pairs two SciPy workhorses: ``solve_ivp`` to SIMULATE a damped
oscillator's ring-down, and ``curve_fit`` to do the inverse - recover the
natural frequency and damping ratio FROM measured response data.
