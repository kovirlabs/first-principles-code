"""dynamics.py - kinematics and rigid-body dynamics calculations.

Dynamics is the study of motion and the forces that cause it. This class
collects the everyday formulas an engineer reaches for: kinematic equations,
projectile motion, Newton's second law, and momentum/energy relations. It also
includes a ``solve_ivp`` example - projectile flight WITH air drag, which has
no closed-form solution and so must be integrated numerically.

Every method takes keyword-only arguments (note the leading ``*``) so that
calls are self-documenting, and every method returns a plain number or tuple so
results compose easily with numpy and scipy.
